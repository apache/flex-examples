A RadioButtonGroup is composed of two or more RadioButton components with the same groupName property. While grouping RadioButton instances in a RadioButtonGroup is optional, a group lets you do things like set a single event handler on a group of RadioButtons, rather than on each individual RadioButton.
				&#xd;&#xd;The RadioButton group can refer to the a group created by the RadioButtonGroup tag. The user selects only one member of the group at a time. Selecting an unselected group member deselects the currently selected RadioButton component within that group.
																		  
				&#xd;&#xd; To use this component in a list-based component, such as a List or DataGrid, create an item renderer. For information about creating an item renderer, see Custom Spark item renderers."/>
