Mirror of Apache Flex Examples

This is a modified version of the new TourDeFlexMobile application that was uploaded to the ApacheFlexExample.

Some Additional code was added to mirror the behavior of the Android Facebook application. Click to slide the main navigator off exposing a list and use mouse events to slide the navigator closed.

The code used to slide off the navigator and slide it back was used from the Madcomponents source code. I modified it to work in a flex environment. It is not as smooth as a pure Madcomonent app, because it does not use Stage3D.
