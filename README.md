Mirror of Apache Flex Examples

This is a new version of TourDeFlexMobile.

Some Additional code was added to mirror the behavior of the Android Facebook application. Click to slide the main navigator off exposing a list and use mouse events to slide the navigator closed.

The code used to slide off the navigator and slide it back was used from the Madcomponents source code. I modified it to work in a flex environment. It is not as smooth as a pure Madcomonent app, because it does not use Stage3D.

***Just added a new mousedown event to slide the top navigator off.***
